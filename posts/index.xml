      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part of Christmas at my family&amp;rsquo;s house is the cookies. Each year, my family cranks out dozens of homemade cookies for a Christmas party, and then more for Christmas Day (because there are never enough left after the party).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was diagnosed with celiac disease in March 2023, when December rolled around, I was sad that my favorite tradition was never going to be the same. Making those family recipes gluten-free, while feasible, never had the same texture or taste. While certain cookies have improved over the years (Andes mint chip cookie recipe - the key was reducing the flour 10%), others remain difficult to convert to a GF version. Here&amp;rsquo;s what last year&amp;rsquo;s cookie tray looked like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to nine national parks, and each of them has been a life-changing experience. In January, we snowshoed in Glacier NP while skiing in Whitefish, MT. In March, my friends and I drove up from LA to Yosemite National Park. In July and August, I spent over three weeks driving around the Rocky Mountains from Austin, Texas all the way up to Yellowstone in Wyoming. Here&amp;rsquo;s my recap, through data and photos!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Image by Victor Moriyama/ISA.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the four years of Jair Bolsonaroâ€™s presidency, 570 children in the Yanomami territory were killed by disease and malnutrition (Machado et al.). The relatively isolated Indigenous tribe in Northwest Brazil has been victim to the quick expansion of illegal mining in the country. The arrival of &lt;em&gt;garimpeiros&lt;/em&gt; (Portuguese term for miners who work in the small-scale gold mining camps) has caused mercury poisoning, the spread of diseases, and the destruction of Yanomami homes and food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
