<h2 id="why-national-parks">Why National Parks?</h2>
<p>When I was younger, going on a hike was my absolute nightmare weekend activity. Growing up going to New Mexico, I would avoid hiking at all costs. If I was forced to go, I would either wait at the trailhead or stick earbuds in and get it over as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This all changed in July 2023, hiking in the Swiss Alps. Walking up into the mountains, by waterfalls, huts, and wildlife, I felt at peace listening to the sounds of the birds, the cowbells, the flowing water, and the wind. All of a sudden, hiking wasn&rsquo;t so bad.</p>
<p><img src="/images/swiss.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I started thinking of my summer graduation trip that year, and continued to plan it into 2024 and nail down the specifics in 2025. Meanwhile, we went to Glacier in January. As I planned, the Trump administration ripped away staffing and funding from the parks. I felt determined to continue supporting our parks as the government continued to turn their backs on these lands. After seeing these parks, I&rsquo;ve seen natural beauty unlike any other and places that feel like true magic. These lands must be protected for generations to come to find the same happiness and inspiration I found in them.</p>

<h4 id="glacier-national-park-mt">Glacier National Park, MT</h4>
<p>While skiing for New Years in Whitefish, Montana (the most north I&rsquo;ve ever been!), we took a tour up to Glacier, which is known for its (well, obviously) glaciers, lakes, and views of the stunning Canadian Rockies. We went snowshoeing, tried huckleberry ice cream, ate lunch by the historical hotel, and enjoyed the views at Lake McDonald. Since this was during winter, we didn&rsquo;t get a chance to explore much, so this is definitely at the top of my list for another trip in summer to experience the trails and wildlife.</p>
<p><img src="/images/glacier.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="yosemite-national-park-ca">Yosemite National Park, CA</h4>
<p>When I planned for this trip, I&rsquo;d read that by late March, most of the snow would be melting. When we arrived in the park and stopped at Bridalveil Falls, it started snowing. Hard. I was really glad that I&rsquo;d suggested that everyone bring snow pants, gloves, and crampons! By the afternoon, things had begun to clear and we walked to Mirror Lake, but we still hadn&rsquo;t seen the iconic valley. The next day, we drove into the park from the Tunnel View side, and I remember my jaw dropping when we exited that tunnel. The views of snow-capped Half Dome, El Cap, Sentinel Dome, and Clouds Rest far in the distance were like nothing I&rsquo;d ever seen before. Hiking up to Yosemite Falls that day was inspiring, and seeing the sequoia trees the next day made this park one of my favorites. Again, I&rsquo;d love to return here in summer and do the JMT/Mist Trail and hike all the way up to Half Dome!</p>

<h4 id="mesa-verde-national-park-co">Mesa Verde National Park, CO</h4>
<p>My mom, my friend Luisa, and I drove up to Cortez, CO from home, the first national park stop on my July trip. After stopping in Taos the night before, we drove into Colorado to see the cliff dwellings. We saw Cliff Palace, hiked a bit to see Balcony House, and did the Mesa Top Loop. It was cool to see the history of the dwellings and understand how the ancient peoples moved from atop the mesa to below, in the cliffs. Super impressive to see how well these ruins have been preserved.</p>
<p><img src="/images/mesaverde.JPG" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="zion-national-park-ut">Zion National Park, UT</h4>
<p>We spent two full days in Zion, which proved to be one of my favorite stops of the trip (and probably top 3 parks for me personally). We got permits to do Angels Landing, and even though I almost chickened out, my mom and I made it all the way up the chains and the view was 1000% worth it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/angelslanding.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The next morning, our tired legs carried us to the Narrows, an iconic hike through the Virgin River. We hiked about 8 miles on the day and made it all the way to Floating Rock. This was a refreshing, fun hike because the water was the perfect temperature and depth, and as you got further into the hike, the crowds dwindled. The picture I&rsquo;ve included is one of my favorites from the trip, it does a decent job showing how deep this canyon is!</p>
<p><img src="/images/narrows.JPG" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="bryce-canyon-national-park-ut">Bryce Canyon National Park, UT</h4>
<p>Bryce is otherworldly, the rocks are so vivid and the wind rustling in the pines while you look out at the amphitheater of rock formations is so peaceful.</p>
<p>The Paiute tribes called the rock formations “oo’doo” (which we mistranslated to be hoodoo), which refers to something scary or that you’re fearful of. They believed that people were turned into rock, hence the people-like appearance of the rocks. The Navajo believed it to be a resting place for the wind people, who brought sand with them from wherever they have been, causing the various colors of the rock. for both, and other tribes, this area was sacred and important to their traditions and beliefs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bryce.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="capitol-reef-national-park-ut">Capitol Reef National Park, UT</h4>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t originally have this one on the itinerary but made a detour on our way to Salt Lake City to see the petroglyphs, strange rock formations, and the historical LDS settlement in Capitol Reef. If your first guess for why it&rsquo;s named that is that there&rsquo;s a rock that looks like the US Capitol and the others look like coral reef, you&rsquo;d be correct! My mom got to enjoy a piece of cherry pie made with local fruit, and I had some ice cream. We also drove around to the see the petroglyphs and of course, Capitol Dome.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cap.JPG" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="grand-teton-national-park-wy">Grand Teton National Park, WY</h4>
<p>We spent three full days in the Tetons, hiking on two days and driving around to see all of the iconic viewpoints on the third. The Tetons, beyond the obvious views of the mountains, have incredible lakes. These mountains are magical, I&rsquo;ve truly never felt anything like it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fam.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>We saw bison cross the road, a bear cub play in Jackson Lake, and so much more. I&rsquo;m already counting down the days til I go back there!</p>
<p><img src="/images/bison.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="yellowstone-national-park-wy">Yellowstone National Park, WY</h4>
<p>Beyond the famous Old Faithful, Yellowstone has so much to offer from its own Grand Canyon to mountains. We saw waterfalls, wildlife from bears to bison, and plenty of geysers. This park is so big that if you know where to look, you can escape the crowds!</p>
<p><img src="/images/artistpt.JPG" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="rocky-mountain-national-park-wy">Rocky Mountain National Park, WY</h4>
<p>The first time I listened to &ldquo;Rocky Mountain High&rdquo; by John Denver, I didn&rsquo;t really get it. But hiking up to these alpine lakes in RMNP, I suddenly understood what he meant by the serenity of a blue mountain lake. We spent two days here hiking, where we saw five (5!!!) lakes and amazing views of Longs Peak, the 14er in the park!</p>
<p><img src="/images/rmnp.JPEG" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="my-hiking-stats">My Hiking Stats</h2>
<p>While hiking in national parks and forests this year, I totaled more than 70 miles and 17,000 feet of elevation gain. The longest hike was in a National Forest in Colorado, which also had the most elevation gain. We hiked up to over 12,500 feet to see lakes at the base of several 14ers, it was absolutely stunning.</p>
<p><img src="/images/colakes2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We did the most hiking in Yellowstone - almost 18 miles - followed by Zion, RMNP, and GTNP. Interestingly, this seems to be correlated with which parks were my favorites, though Yosemite is an outlier with that trend since we visited in winter where more trails are closed/covered in snow.</p>

<p>While some parks have managed to overcome the <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/9551-staffing-crisis-at-national-parks-reaches-breaking-point-new-data-shows-24">24% staffing cuts</a> since April by reassigning staff priorities, others were still struggling by July with a variety of closures and service reductions. The <em>New York Times</em> studied <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/politics/trump-cuts-national-parks.html">the impacts of the cuts on Zion National Park</a> specifically, where we saw the fee entrance station reduced hours and facility closures first-hand.</p>
<p>Based on an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10h9-toHjHGjcBmhdUDZst9ZiHWUu7dM0/edit?gid=2112820164#gid=2112820164">internal report</a> obtained from the National Parks Conservation Association, I found that 19 of the 63 national parks are currently experiencing issues caused by staffing shortages. The map below shows parks by color based on whether they currently are suffering the effects of the cuts. Users can filter to view only parks experiencing issues, search for a particular park, and click on the park to see what issues they&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>

<iframe src="/widgets/leaflet_map.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Mount Rainier, Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon, Wind Cave, and Yosemite all reported issues in April but have resolved the issues by onboarding seasonal staff or reassigning staff to address the closures.</p>
<p>The internal report categorized the closures and reduced services by type, which I mostly adhered to with those used in this analysis, but I also reported additional closures based on the parks&rsquo; descriptions of the issues. For example, Death Valley has experienced delays in disaster relief projects, which the report marked as &ldquo;Roads,&rdquo; but I also marked that Death Valley&rsquo;s disaster relief has been affected by staffing shortages, as described in the report. &ldquo;Entrances&rdquo; refers to any affected fee collection sites, contact stations, or park entrances. &ldquo;Facilities&rdquo; refers to closures related to bathrooms and water services. &ldquo;Programs&rdquo; refers to any Ranger-led tours, educational programs, and permits.</p>
