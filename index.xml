      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part of Christmas at my family&amp;rsquo;s house is the cookies. Each year, my family cranks out dozens of homemade cookies for a Christmas party, and then more for Christmas Day (because there are never enough left after the party).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was diagnosed with celiac disease in March 2023, when December rolled around, I was sad that my favorite tradition was never going to be the same. Making those family recipes gluten-free, while feasible, never had the same texture or taste. While certain cookies have improved over the years (Andes mint chip cookie recipe - the key was reducing the flour 10%), others remain difficult to convert to a GF version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to nine national parks, and each of them has been a life-changing experience. In January, we snowshoed in Glacier NP while skiing in Whitefish, MT. In March, my friends and I drove up from LA to Yosemite National Park. In July and August, I spent over three weeks driving around the Rocky Mountains from Austin, Texas all the way up to Yellowstone in Wyoming. Here&amp;rsquo;s my recap, through data and photos!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Devastating Effects of Illegal Mining in North Brazil</title>

Image by Victor Moriyama/ISA.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the four years of Jair Bolsonaroâ€™s presidency, 570 children in the Yanomami territory were killed by disease and malnutrition (Machado et al.). The relatively isolated Indigenous tribe in Northwest Brazil has been victim to the quick expansion of illegal mining in the country. The arrival of &lt;em&gt;garimpeiros&lt;/em&gt; (Portuguese term for miners who work in the small-scale gold mining camps) has caused mercury poisoning, the spread of diseases, and the destruction of Yanomami homes and food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/me2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Graduation photo of me&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Bianca and I&amp;rsquo;m a recent graduate of Rice University and a current MSDS student at UT Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always seen the world through the lens of numbers and data. Statistics were always my go-to when writing a paper or having a debate with a classmate I disagreed with. As I developed my data skills through the Rice political science and data science coursework, I became passionate about using data visualization and storytelling to bridge the gap between complex data and the people who need to understand it. Translating complex research into actionable insights is critical to maintaining a transparent, accountable democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my time at Rice, I worked as an intern at the Baker Institute, where I contributed to publications for the Drug Policy Program, and worked with Dr. Alida Metcalf to publish my narrative about Romani people in Rio de Janeiro on the ImagineRio website. Finally, I also assisted with research at the Comptroller of Public Accounts in the summer of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bakerinstitute.org/opioid-settlement-expenditures-texas&#34;&gt;Opioid Settlement Expenditures in Texas - Baker Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
