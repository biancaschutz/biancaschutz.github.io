Hi! My name is Bianca and I&rsquo;m a recent graduate of Rice University and a current MSDS student at UT Austin.
I&rsquo;ve always seen the world through the lens of numbers and data. Statistics were always my go-to when writing a paper or having a debate with a classmate I disagreed with. As I developed my data skills through the Rice political science and data science coursework, I became passionate about using data visualization and storytelling to bridge the gap between complex data and the people who need to understand it. Translating complex research into actionable insights is critical to maintaining a transparent, accountable democracy.">

<p>Hi! My name is Bianca and I&rsquo;m a recent graduate of Rice University and a current MSDS student at UT Austin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always seen the world through the lens of numbers and data. Statistics were always my go-to when writing a paper or having a debate with a classmate I disagreed with. As I developed my data skills through the Rice political science and data science coursework, I became passionate about using data visualization and storytelling to bridge the gap between complex data and the people who need to understand it. Translating complex research into actionable insights is critical to maintaining a transparent, accountable democracy.</p>
<p>To continue learning new data viz techniques and practice my writing, I decided to start this blog in my free time. Here, I&rsquo;ll cover not only all sorts of topics that I&rsquo;m interested in, from sports to politics, but also bits and pieces of my life - all through visual and data-driven storytelling.</p>
